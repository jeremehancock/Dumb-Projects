## 🎯 What's This About?

This is my personal portfolio showcasing a bunch of experimental projects I've built with AI assistance. Each project started as a "what if..." moment and evolved into something unexpectedly useful (or at least entertaining).

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🎮 **AI Game Collection**

A collection of 15+ browser-based games created entirely with AI assistance! From classic Snake and Minesweeper to unique puzzles, all with a modern dark theme.

### 🎬 **Posteria**

Plex poster chaos, solved! A slick web app for organizing and managing custom movie and TV show posters with automatic artwork fetching.

### 📺 **Glimpse**

A gorgeous web interface for browsing your Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby media libraries with trailers, cast info, and a "roll the dice" random picker.

### 📈 **Media Stats**

A clean, modern dashboard for monitoring your Plex Media Server with beautiful visualizations and streaming insights.

### 💻 **CLIX**

Who needs a GUI? A slick command-line Plex media player with fuzzy search and that satisfying terminal aesthetic.

### 😀 **EmojiFind**

Find any emoji instantly! Lightning-fast search with dark/light themes, one-click copy, and mobile optimization.

### 📱 **QR**

Generate high-quality QR codes instantly and scan them with your phone's camera! Features real-time scanning, smart URL detection, and a sleek terminal-inspired dark theme that works offline.

## ✨ The Philosophy

These projects range from genuinely useful to "why did you make this?" but they're all built with:

- ❤️ Love for experimentation
- ☕ Too much coffee
- 🤖 AI assistance and creative freedom
- 🎨 A belief that beautiful chaos can happen

Most started as quick experiments that got way out of hand. Turns out when you give AI some creative freedom, magic happens!
